Convert a JATS XML document to a MyST AST.

Portions of this package were created for `jats-to-myst` and [committed](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/commits/mystmd%401.3.12/packages/jats-to-myst/src) to project Jupyter's `mystmd` project. The work is licensed MIT in both places, `jats-convert` has additional functionality and nuance depending on the publisher.
